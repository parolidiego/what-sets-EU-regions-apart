# What sets European regions apart?
 
The project tries to understand what are the main differences across European Union’s NUTS-3 level regions by applying several statistical and supervised machine learning techniques to socio-economic and environmental data from the OECD to:

1. Classify each EU NUTS-3 region into its continental subregion (Eastern, Western, Northern or Southern Europe)
      - Multinomial logistic regression
      - LDA
      - K-Nearest-Neighbor
      - Random Forest
      - Gradient Boosting
2. Predict EU NUTS-3 regions’ GDP
      - Linear regression
      - Stepwise feature selection for linear regression
      - Elastic Net
      - K-Nearest-Neighbor
      - Random Forest
      - Gradient Boosting
      - Neural Network

This project was produced as the second assignment for the Advanced Modelling course in the Master in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. It was focused primarly on building predictive models, both for classification and regression methods and it allowed me to implement many different models, compare them, understand their strength and weaknesses and interpret their results.

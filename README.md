# What sets European regions apart?
 
The project tries to understand what are the main differences across European Union’s NUTS-3 level regions applying statistical and machine learning techniques to socio-economic and environmental data to:

1. Classify each NUTS-3 region into its continental subregion (Eastern, Western, Northern or Southern Europe) using:
    - Multinomial logistic regression
    - LDA
    - K-Nearest-Neighbor
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
3. Predict NUTS-3 regions’ GDP using:
    - Linear regression
    - Stepwise feature selection for linear regression
    - Elastic Net
    - K-Nearest-Neighbor
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Neural Network

This repository was produced as the second assignment for the Advanced Modelling course in the Master in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
